Ling Yang is currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Peking University, advised by [Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/), [Luxia Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qvRlo5wAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Ming-Hsuan Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p9-ohHsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). His research interests are Generative Models/Diffusion Models, Multimodal Learning, and AI for Science. He worked with [Yang Song](https://yang-song.net/), [Bernard Ghanem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rVsGTeEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Stefano Ermon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ogXTOZ4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Jure Leskovec](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q_kKkIUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). He now serves as a program committee member or reviewer for international conferences and journals including TPAMI, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, CVPR, KDD, AAAI.
