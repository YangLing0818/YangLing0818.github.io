Ling Yang is a second-year PhD student at Peking University in Beijing, advised by Bin Cui and Luxia Zhang. Before that, He received the Bachelor and Master degrees from Honors College in Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2018 and 2021, advised by [Yuchao Dai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fddAbqsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Mingyi He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gLnLpAsAAAAJ&hl=en). He worked with [Yang Song](https://yang-song.net/), [Bernard Ghanem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rVsGTeEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN),  [Ming-Hsuan Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p9-ohHsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and [Jure Leskovec](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q_kKkIUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). His research interests are Generative Models, Multimodal Learning, Self-supervised Learning, and AI for Science. He now serves as a reviewer for international conferences and journals including TPAMI, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, CVPR, KDD, AAAI. Our lab is recruiting self-motivated interns who have a strong passion for Generative Models/Diffusion Models. If you are interested, please send email with your CV.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
