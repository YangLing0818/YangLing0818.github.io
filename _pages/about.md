Ling Yang is currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Peking University, advised by [Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/), [Luxia Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qvRlo5wAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Ming-Hsuan Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p9-ohHsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My research interests are Diffusion Models, Multimodal Learning, and AI for Science. I previously worked with [Yang Song](https://yang-song.net/), [Shuicheng Yan](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=DNuiPHwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Bernard Ghanem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rVsGTeEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Stefano Ermon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ogXTOZ4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Jure Leskovec](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q_kKkIUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I serve as a program committee member or reviewer for international conferences and journals including SIGGRAPH, TPAMI, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, CVPR, KDD, AAAI. 

I am in charge of a reasearch team and have led a series of works on Diffusion Models and LLMs including [RPG-DiffusionMaster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11708), [VideoTetris](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04277) and [Buffer of Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04271), and published [a book about Diffusion Models](https://item.m.jd.com/product/14075554.html). Feel free to email me for potential collaborations or discussions. Alternatively, my WeChat ID: jifengjianhao_yl.
