Ling Yang is a Ph.D. student at Peking University, advised by [Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/) and [Luxia Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qvRlo5wAAAAJ&hl=en). His research interests are Generative Models, Multimodal Learning, and AI for Science. He currently works with [Yang Song](https://yang-song.net/), [Bernard Ghanem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rVsGTeEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN),  [Ming-Hsuan Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p9-ohHsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and [Jure Leskovec](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q_kKkIUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).  He now serves as a program committee member or reviewer for international conferences and journals including TPAMI, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, CVPR, KDD, AAAI.

Before that, He received the Bachelor and Master degrees from Honors College in Northwestern Polytechnical University, advised by [Yuchao Dai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fddAbqsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Mingyi He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gLnLpAsAAAAJ&hl=en).
