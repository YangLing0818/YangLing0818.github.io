Ling Yang is a Ph.D. student at Peking University, advised by [Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/) and [Luxia Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qvRlo5wAAAAJ&hl=en). His research interests are Generative Models, Multimodal Learning, and AI for Science. He currently works with [Yang Song](https://yang-song.net/), [Bernard Ghanem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rVsGTeEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN),  [Ming-Hsuan Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p9-ohHsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and [Jure Leskovec](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q_kKkIUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).  He now serves as a program committee member or reviewer for international conferences and journals including TPAMI, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, CVPR, KDD, AAAI.

Before that, He received the Bachelor and Master degrees from Honors College in Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2018 and 2021, advised by [Yuchao Dai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fddAbqsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Mingyi He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gLnLpAsAAAAJ&hl=en).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section



For more info
------
More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
